Hello!👋🏽 

My name is Mustafa Hussain. I am a software engineer who spends the majority of his time seeking out new, innovative solutions related to the software engineering. That being said, I always do my best to develop high-quality backend solutions for my clients.

In the 7+ years that I have spent as part of the software engineering industry, I have managed to build a lot of stuff that helped me to improve both my collaboration skills and my analytical skills. Building highly scalable backend services is something that I am always interested in.

Apart from being a software engineer, I also like to spend some of my time reading 📚, brewing coffee☕️ and doing a long distance running 🏃🏾.
