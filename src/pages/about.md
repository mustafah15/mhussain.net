Hello!👋🏽

Hi, I’m Mustafa Hussain — a senior software engineer with many years of experience building scalable backend systems.
Throughout my career, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects that have sharpened my analytical thinking and strengthened my ability to collaborate with diverse teams. I enjoy writing clean, maintainable code and diving deep into architecture and system design.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me out on a long-distance run, experimenting with coffee brewing methods, or reading about topics that range from software design to sociology. I’m curious by nature — always exploring how things work and how they could work better.

This blog is my safe space where I share my thoughts on different topics that I find interesting without being judged by social media algorithms. I write about software engineering, distributed systems, and anything else that sparks my curiosity. I hope you find something here that resonates with you!
