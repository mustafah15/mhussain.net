I have been running pretty consistently for the last two years, and I am feeling this is the moment when I should sign up for a marathon but still I have the fear that my training wouldn't be enough to run that long distance (42km) in 3:30 hours (my personal goal for the first marathon) I fear that I don't have the stamina that is require run 60 to 70 km per week during the training weeks this intensity I have never experienced yet! 

With my current work schedule, I should be able to do so but for a father, there are other things to do rather than running and coding, family time is important too.

With all those concerns and fears I decided to go on and start the training plan, I found this amazing [YouTube list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO05AdllSAieCsZxOI8yG1cCfLe5LAScj) from Floberg's YT Chanel, he introduced to me this great book [Advanced Marathoning](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Pete-Pfitzinger/dp/149256866X) which has many training plans that people who are willing to race a marathon can pick from I picked the shortest, smallest one and adjusted it to my needs you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QuTjz59TZ8hLkRUCA-kXY8Db-ZEpGPQhNHsTGGDNW_o/edit#gid=0) and I am doing like Floberg did I will mark every successful workout with green and every adjusted workout with yellow and every canceled workout with red (I hope that I don't have to do this), also regarding the other part of the training which is nutrition and strength training I found a great coach who is willing to mentor/help me to achieve my goal, so thank you, Coach Bo.

By the way, my goal is to run the Munich Marathon on the 8th of October 2023 under 3 hours 30 minutes, not sure if I can do it but I will give it a try. ü§ûüèæ
 
update: I ended it not running the marathon because I was layed off from my job on september 2023 and I didn't have the time to train for it, I will try again in 2024. however I ran my PB in half marathon 1:42:00 in 2023.
