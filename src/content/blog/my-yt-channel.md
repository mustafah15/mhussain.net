Since it sounds pretty fun posting videos on YouTube and I have been doing it for a while 2 months now (4 videos so far) I thought it would be a good idea to document my thoughts and plans for this channel.

## My Vision For this Channel

This channel is my way of sharing stuff that I am interested in and I wanted to document it at the same I hope that it will be useful for others who are looking for Arabic content in this area.
### What I am interested in
- Software Engineering and Software Architecture
- Building Personal Knowledge Base System (PKM)
- HomeLab-ing

## RoadMap

### Single Videos
Small ideas that don't require much effort to prepare and recording
- Intro video about the channel and myself
- Transactional outbox pattern
- Building a neovim setup
- Attending DDD Europe 2024

### Series / Courses
A complete skill that requires multiple sessions to be prepared, recorded, reviewed, and edited.
This is sorted by low effort -> high effort, I will record those series twice one in Arabic which will be free and published on YT and another version will be recorded in English which will be published on Udemy.

- Series - Building Personal Knowledge Base System
- Series - Let's Read Some Code
- Series - Domain Driven Design
- Series - Distributed Systems Fundamentals
