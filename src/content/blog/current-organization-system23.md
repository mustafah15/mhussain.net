This is just another piece of documentation about my organization system since systems evolve over time, this is what fits me today and might change in the future.

So in a nutshell these are the digital/physical tools I use every day (2023) to help me more organized and "productive"

1- Bullet Journal
Pen and paper first thing in the morning is the best way to huddle my anxiety and frustration before the day hits me with its problems.
I try to log everything as much as I can and to follow the rapid logging concept which I find is the only way to help my faulty brain to function.
This is my current [journal](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B0B8ZPLLGW?psc=1), and [pen](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/ dp/B00GS8HO34?psc=1).

2- Logseq
[Logseq](https://logseq.com/) is my digital note-taking app of choice, it's minimal easy to learn, and fun to work with I use it to build [my digital zettelk√§sten](https://github.com (/mustafah15/zettelkasten)
I have different projects/graphs in Logseq one for work and another one for my technical notes which I open-sourced and deployed on https://zettelkasten.mhussain.net/#/graph

4-day

This is where I journal it's really special because you can attach photos & videos from that day and have it with some sentences you add to describe your feelings or state :)

As I mentioned above this is what I currently use and fit my needs might change it later, remember these are just tools.
